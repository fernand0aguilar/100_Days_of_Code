# 100 Days Of ML Code

***

### Day 0:
July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 days of ML Code

**Thoughts:** I had already set myself up for coding for the last 15 days, and now I will start focusing only on machine learning to learn more about this promising field and unveil the computer's mind.

### Day 1:
09-07-2018 , 23:37

**Today's Progress:** Watched the module 10 - Introduction to Data and APIs

**Thoughts:** I am starting slowly first, focusing on learning more about data is a good way to start because a good dataset will be the main beginning to having a good model for training the algorithm later.

### Day 2:
10-07-2018 , 21:35

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about tensors - Intelligence and learning

**Thoughts:** Lazy day. Slept nothing last night and thus today was a day for me to get better and slow down. I found the Asteroids video for making a bot and I am excited to keep doing this challenge for the next week. I want to learn more about tensorflow.js, finish de api giphy project and also keep going in the tutorials and projects.

### Day 3:
11-07-2018 , 21:49

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about APIs

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I felt some resistance. I am focusing more on letting go of things that are no longer benefiting me in order to be able to focus on this project and learn more about machine learning. I had the mentor.me idea which was very positive.

### Day 4:
12-07-2018 , 22:57 

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about data structures

**Thoughts:** Watched some videos about binary trees, particle systems and also got to build the fireworks system uppon the physics engine that I had already made. Although this might not be directly related to ML it feels like a very nice grounding for getting deeper into ML concepts further on.

### Day 5:
13-07-2018 , 22:08 

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About A* Pathfinding Algorithm

**Thoughts:** It's going solid so far. Learning about algorithms is the first part of how I'm planning to work with data. I will start implementing these thing into code and then progress trough the whole data thing.

### Day 6:
14-07-2018 , 22:51 

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** I was focused on coding for the p5-projects repo the whole day sdidn't learned much stuff directly related to Machine Learning. What I actually got to do was learn more about mathematics and trigonometry after implementing the oscillation chapter on NOC. I also watched a video about evolutionary algorithms which was very dense and explanatory. Feeling happy for today

### Day 7:
15-07-2018 , 18:00 

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about depth-first search algorithm

### Day 8:
16-07-2018 , 22:42 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Algorithms Section & Started Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Solid day. Coded for more than 3 hours and made some good progress along with my focus and coding skills. Today is the start of second week and I'm happy to be focused and coding, increasing the skills and discovering what I can or cannot do with them.

### Day 9:
17-07-2018 , 23:42 

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about cellular automata

**Thoughts:** I is being easier to code in the midnight and i don't think this is very optimized at a long term perspective. Altho, I am being really more productive here and it's time for me to act and create a and this is what I'm currently doing. I am afraid to burn out with the coding train videos and not have a place to go for more knowledge. But these are maybe just silly concerns because he is a great mentor with lots of valuable wise videos.

### Day 10:
18-07-2018 , 19:48 

**Today's Progress:** Starting to read Luan's Tcc

**Thoughts:** Luan was a roomate when I was at FGA. He wrote a very good article about Machine Learning, Clusterization, the impact of algorithms on thlitics and democracy and how to use a smart approach on social discussions. I am beggining to read his 80-pg long final project and learn more about the in depth details of the problem and its sulution.

### Day 11:
19-07-2018 , 22:32 

**Today's Progress:** Reading Luan's Tcc and Learning more about Fractals

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day because I programmed even if I didn't want to. It was nice to read luan's tcc and discover more about machine learning in portuguese. His perspective is a complex one but has some value, especially when we described the avarage descendent and ways to calculate data.

**Today's Progress:** Studying more of genetic algorithms and ML5 first glance

**Thoughts:** Today was a day focused on not getting influenced by the negativity. It was a nice day regarding all the trials that were in my path. I watched Dan Shiffman's live on what it is the ml5 library and how to use it for an easy on-the-browser formulation of machine learning tasks and applications

### Day 14:
22-07-2018 , 23:39 

**Today's Progress:** Reading Luan's paper and coding visual graphics

**Thoughts:** Today was a day where I could implement another project using evolutionary (genetic) algorithms and also, I focused on learning more about machine learning by itself. I realized that the goal of machine learning is to optimize something, and that we can do it in many ways. I watched this video about k-means clustering and learned a lot from it.

24-07-2018 , 23:32 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Session 02 and started Session 3 - introduction to machine learning

**Thoughts:** I was very happy when implementing a particle by myself. This feeling of being able to do something that I wasn't before is very satisfying even if it's a simple thing. Today I want to look at the nearest neighbors reccomendation engine and learn more about the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

**Today's Progress:** Gradient Descendent and Calculus

**Thoughts:** Learned more about how is halculus involved in gradient descent. Rememebered a lot of stuff related to derivatives and integrals. I realized that calculus was involved in machine learning all the time, and also related to what i've been coding as visual graphics. Right now I'm seeing a near breaktrough in what I've been doing as subject of habits.

### Day 21:
29-07-2018 , 23:40 

**Today's Progress:** Starting To Learn Neural Networks

**Thoughts:** Today I come up to see what it really means neural network. I started by implementing an algorithm for doing linear regression using a single perceptron(neuron) model and understood what the hidden layer is. I watched a few videos on the meaning of deep learning and I am happy to be making progress. Overall today was great and I am very happy on the 21th day of this challenge. 79 more to go. Wishing me consistency, and valuable forces.

**Today's Progress:** Studying the math behind matrixes

**Thoughts:** Today I got a solid coding day with 3 projects but only one of them involving direct machine learning. I copied the code for firing neurons at the nature of code book repository and also learned more about the math part of neural networks. With the inner linear algebra matrix sum and multiplication.
