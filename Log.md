# 100 Days Of ML Code

***

### Day 0:
July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 days of ML Code

**Thoughts:** I had already set myself up for coding for the last 15 days, and now I will start focusing only on machine learning to learn more about this promising field and unveil the computer's mind.

### Day 1:
09-07-2018 , 23:37

**Today's Progress:** Watched the module 10 - Introduction to Data and APIs

**Thoughts:** I am starting slowly first, focusing on learning more about data is a good way to start because a good dataset will be the main beginning to having a good model for training the algorithm later.

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about tensors - Intelligence and learning

**Thoughts:** Lazy day. Slept nothing last night and thus today was a day for me to get better and slow down. I found the Asteroids video for making a bot and I am excited to keep doing this challenge for the next week. I want to learn more about tensorflow.js, finish de api giphy project and also keep going in the tutorials and projects.

### Day 3:
11-07-2018 , 21:49

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about APIs

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I felt some resistance. I am focusing more on letting go of things that are no longer benefiting me in order to be able to focus on this project and learn more about machine learning. I had the mentor.me idea which was very positive.
