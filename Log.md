# 100 Days Of ML Code

***

### Day 0:
July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 days of ML Code

**Thoughts:** I had already set myself up for coding for the last 15 days, and now I will start focusing only on machine learning to learn more about this promising field and unveil the computer's mind.

### Day 1:
09-07-2018 , 23:37

**Today's Progress:** Watched the module 10 - Introduction to Data and APIs

**Thoughts:** I am starting slowly first, focusing on learning more about data is a good way to start because a good dataset will be the main beginning to having a good model for training the algorithm later.

### Day 2:
10-07-2018 , 21:35

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about tensors - Intelligence and learning

**Thoughts:** Lazy day. Slept nothing last night and thus today was a day for me to get better and slow down. I found the Asteroids video for making a bot and I am excited to keep doing this challenge for the next week. I want to learn more about tensorflow.js, finish de api giphy project and also keep going in the tutorials and projects.

### Day 3:
11-07-2018 , 21:49

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about APIs

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I felt some resistance. I am focusing more on letting go of things that are no longer benefiting me in order to be able to focus on this project and learn more about machine learning. I had the mentor.me idea which was very positive.

### Day 4:
12-07-2018 , 22:57 

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about data structures

**Thoughts:** Watched some videos about binary trees, particle systems and also got to build the fireworks system uppon the physics engine that I had already made. Although this might not be directly related to ML it feels like a very nice grounding for getting deeper into ML concepts further on.

### Day 5:
13-07-2018 , 22:08 

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About A* Pathfinding Algorithm

**Thoughts:** It's going solid so far. Learning about algorithms is the first part of how I'm planning to work with data. I will start implementing these thing into code and then progress trough the whole data thing.

### Day 6:
14-07-2018 , 22:51 

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** I was focused on coding for the p5-projects repo the whole day sdidn't learned much stuff directly related to Machine Learning. What I actually got to do was learn more about mathematics and trigonometry after implementing the oscillation chapter on NOC. I also watched a video about evolutionary algorithms which was very dense and explanatory. Feeling happy for today

### Day 7:
15-07-2018 , 18:00 

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about depth-first search algorithm

**Thoughts:** Didn't wanted to code at all but at least implemented the blobs project and then studied more about the philosophy of life and how we can figure out a way to search for the future of humanity.

### Day 8:
16-07-2018 , 22:42 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Algorithms Section & Started Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Solid day. Coded for more than 3 hours and made some good progress along with my focus and coding skills. Today is the start of second week and I'm happy to be focused and coding, increasing the skills and discovering what I can or cannot do with them.

### Day 9:
17-07-2018 , 23:42 

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about cellular automata

**Thoughts:** I is being easier to code in the midnight and i don't think this is very optimized at a long term perspective. Altho, I am being really more productive here and it's time for me to act and create a and this is what I'm currently doing. I am afraid to burn out with the coding train videos and not have a place to go for more knowledge. But these are maybe just silly concerns because he is a great mentor with lots of valuable wise videos.

### Day 10:
18-07-2018 , 19:48 

**Today's Progress:** Starting to read Luan's Tcc

**Thoughts:** Luan was a roomate when I was at FGA. He wrote a very good article about Machine Learning, Clusterization, the impact of algorithms on thlitics and democracy and how to use a smart approach on social discussions. I am beggining to read his 80-pg long final project and learn more about the in depth details of the problem and its sulution.

### Day 11:
19-07-2018 , 22:32 

**Today's Progress:** Reading Luan's Tcc and Learning more about Fractals

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day because I programmed even if I didn't want to. It was nice to read luan's tcc and discover more about machine learning in portuguese. His perspective is a complex one but has some value, especially when we described the avarage descendent and ways to calculate data.

### Day 12:
20-07-2018 , 23:39 

**Today's Progress:** Studying more of genetic algorithms and ML5 first glance

**Thoughts:** Today was a day focused on not getting influenced by the negativity. It was a nice day regarding all the trials that were in my path. I watched Dan Shiffman's live on what it is the ml5 library and how to use it for an easy on-the-browser formulation of machine learning tasks and applications

### Day 13:
21-07-2018 , 23:43 

**Today's Progress:** Learned a lot about Evolutionary Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Today was a solid day with something like 3 hours of code. I got to learn more about genetic algorithms and copy the code for smart rockets while also learning more about the inner works of the genetic monkey project.
